## Motivation

I'm attempting to learn Angular and am about to start using Webpack, rather than using a seed I thought I should run through the basics of Webpack so I'll understand it better.

### Run

```
$ webpack ./entry.js bundle.js

```

With CSS Binding

```
webpack ./entry.js bundle.js --module-bind 'css=style!css'
```
